Section 1: Materials You'll Need
1/3 bag of Xmas straw (white straw and coloured straw is also great)

Half bottle of water

Clear resin glitter

Floral tape

Scissors

Masking tape

Small heart shaped Q-Tip

Clothes pegs

DIRECTIONS

1. Tie the Xmas straw into a circle using floral tape.

2. Using a small heart-shaped Q-Tip, apply the clear resin glitter all over the straw wreath ring.

3. Using an exacto knife, trim the straw wreath ring if necessary, before sticking it to a tree branch, or wrapping it around a candle.

4. Leave the wreath ring for 24 hours to dry before using.

5. Cover the wreath with a layer of clear resin glitter and attach the Floral tape.


Instructions 
Thread a cotton ball through the centre of a straw wreath base so it sticks out from the centre, and then stuff with your choice of decorations.

Mix two types of straws and hot glue the ends to form a ring.

Scatter your choice of decoration for the centre of the wreath.

Stretch the end of the wreath so you have two loops, starting in the middle of the wreath and going up to the top.

Tie the ends of the wreath together with a piece of string.

String a string from the centre to the top of the wreath, passing over the two loops so they can be tied together with the string.

Attach the two loops of the wreath together and tie with string.
